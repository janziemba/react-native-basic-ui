```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-native-basic-ui
```

Also, complete installation of [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) and [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient#installation), otherwise you won't be able to use the Icon component and linear gradients.
